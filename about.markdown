I am a dedicated game programmer with passion for creating engaging gameplay experiences. My technical expertise lies in developing gameplay mechanics, combat systems, animations, and AI. Currently I am improving my skills in engine programming.

Outside of work, I have a deep appreciation for Japanese culture, which inspires creativity in both my professional and personal life.
